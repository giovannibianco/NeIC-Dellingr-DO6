In this \pilot the resources were allocated in a different manner than the first pilot.
In this case the users requested specific resources not in their country through the portal. 
In the first pilot, the users requested an amount of computing time and were assigned to a resource manually by the \dell project.
Also, the self-service portal expressed the \einfra resources in a common format ``Billing Units" (BU)~\footnote{In general for all \dell resources, 1 CPU core has been set to cost 0.01 BU per month and one GPU core cost is 0.1 BU per month.}.

The \dell \pilot was launched in June~2019 and the last applications were received in December~2019. 
These figures summarize the extent of the Pilot~\footnote{As of \today}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 13 applications were received;
\item \accepted projects were accepted;
\item \BUreq BU were granted to the accepted projects;
\item \BUcons BU were consumed by the projects.
\end{itemize}
Only two applications were rejected. 
Two of the twelve applications accepted were handled through channels other than the self-service portal.
One was a Danish continuation of resource usage from the first \dell pilot and was handled through the Swedish SUPR~\cite{supr} portal.
The other was am Icelandic continuation of resource usage from the first \dell pilot and was handled through the CSC Service Desk~\cite{csc-service-desk}.

\todo[inline]{PN: Check the numbers above. How much was granted... or should it be how much was requested? \\ PN: Remember to update final numbers.}

Table~\ref{tab:projects} shows the orders for resources received from users.

\todo[inline]{Why there is a double project "Simulating Electronic and Nuclear Dynamics in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells" in Table~\ref{tab:projects}?}
\todo[inline]{PN: Removed full stops (.) from project titles in Table~\ref{tab:projects} (done) \\
PN: Should we show granted BUs instead of requested in Table~\ref{tab:projects}? \\
JW: Changed to allocated BUs here and in the text. \\
PN: I have put allocated BUs for projects run at CSC. \\
PN: I will update usage figures in Table~\ref{tab:projects} on 13th March. \\
PN: Remember to update Total allocated and Total used in Table~\ref{tab:projects}.}
As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:projects} the amount of BUs requested varies over two orders of magnitude.
The amount of BUs consumed by the project also varies from very little (zero) to multiples of the original allocation.
One project, with a BU consumption of "n/a" was not correctly assigned an allocation due to a misunderstanding in the project setup stages.
Overall, the rate of BUs consumed is very low.

Table~\ref{tab:results} shows the resource requests between client and hosting countries.

\todo[inline]{PN: Remember to update final numbers in Table~\ref{tab:results}. \\ JW: Hopefully Table 2 does not need to be updated. Only Table 1.}
As the number of accepted projects was \accepted and the number of entries in Table~\ref{tab:results} is 8, it can be seen that most countries managed to generate 1 request.
The exception to this was Iceland that generated 6 projects and, to a lesser extent, Denmark that generated 3 projects.
It can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:results} that one country (Finland) hosted the majority of the projects and BUs and one country (Iceland) generated the 
majority of the projects but not the majority of the BUs requested.
