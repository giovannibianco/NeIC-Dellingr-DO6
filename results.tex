In this \pilot the resources were allocated in a different manner than the first pilot.
In this case the users requested specific resources not in their country through the portal. 
In the first pilot, the users requested an amount of computing time and were assigned to a resource manually by the \dell project.
Also, the portal expressed the \einfra resources in a common format ``Billing Units" (BU)~\footnote{In general for all \dell resources, 1 CPU core has been set to cost 0.01 BU per month and one GPU core cost is 0.1 BU per month.}.

The \dell \pilot was launched in June~2019 and the last applications were received in December~2019. 
These figures summarize the extent of the Pilot:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12 applications were received;
\item 10 projects were accepted;
\item XX BU were granted to the accepted projects;
\item YY BU were consumed by the projects.
\end{itemize}
Only two applications were rejected. 

Table~\ref{tab:projects} shows the orders for resources received from users.

\todo[inline]{AS: There was a continuation project of the Danish project from the first pilot. They only applied through the SUPR interface which is why it doesn't show up in Waldur. The title is "Local structural correlations in Sn doped BCZT ferroelectric relaxors" they requested 75kch/month over 4 months i.e. 300kch=3000bu. I'd say that this should count as well even though they didn't go through the portal.} 
\todo[inline,backgroundcolor=red!25]{JW: Agree. Will add to the table.}
\todo[inline]{PN: I added another similar case to the table: Project "Simulating Electronic and Nuclear Dynamics in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells" is a continuation project from the first pilot, applied through CSC Service Desk.}
\todo[inline]{PN: I updated Total Requested in the table.}
As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:projects} the amount of BUs requested varies over two orders of magnitude.
Table~\ref{tab:results} shows the resource requests between client and hosting countries.

As the number of accepted projects was 10 and the number of entries in Table~\ref{tab:projects} is 6, it can be seen that most countries only managed to generate 1 request.
The exception to this was Iceland that generated 6 projects and, to a lesser extent, Denmark that generated 2 projects.
