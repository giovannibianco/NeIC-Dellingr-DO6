\begin{enumerate}
\item If you are a user of both the first and second Dellingr pilots... How does the experience compare between the two pilots?

\item How easy was it to get the account on the "foreign" shared resources?

\item Did you need application support? If so, did it work well?

\item Did you have licensing issues? Were they solved?

\item If your project did not use all the allocated resources, why was this
the case?

\item Other comments on the application framework and/or process?

1. I wasn't. 

2. To be perfectly honest, I found the infrastructure around getting accounts and project management 
etc slightly byzantine. But it probably wasn't helped by the fact that I kinda got stuck with two 
accounts for some reason related to my dual employment at two different universities, both using 
the wayf login. What I'm saying is, it was 50%-75% my own fault :) 

3. No.

4. No issues

5. I think I used almost all of them, if not all. 
6. None i can think of currently. Thanks for letting me be  part of the pilot!

\subsection*{ Responses 2}

1. I have been using resources from CSC/Finland in both pilots. The experiences have been rather similar, 
in both cases positive throughout. Their are two large differences between the rounds are: 
i) the new application system for the latest round, which was a bit tricky to understand at first 
but the platform seems to have good future potential; ii) the new computer cluster at csc (puhti), 
which works very well.

2. It was easy the first round, and this time I already had an account making it very smooth.

3. Not this round. Last round we had minor issues that the support could solve quickly

4. Not this round. Last round we needed to confirm our VASP license, which took a few days. 
This is however very common for this program.

5. We have not yet had time to use all, but we will.

6. Not at this point, other than that is has been working well and that I consider this a very useful 
and good initiative
