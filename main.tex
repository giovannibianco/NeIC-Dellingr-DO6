\section{Executive Summary}
\label{sec-exec-summ}

The NeIC \dell project is investigating how a lightweight framework for sharing High Performance Computing~(HPC) resources~\footnote{Defined generally as compute, network and storage \einfra.} can be implemented between participating countries~\footnote{Currently this includes the Nordic countries and Estonia.}.
The \dell project has established two temporary trials (pilots) of cross border \einfra resource sharing in order to validate the policies and practicalities. 
The \einfra resources were opened to eligible researchers~\footnote{At the moment we do not address commercial users that some countries have agreements to provide/use resources.} from the participating countries who wished to access resources in other participating countries.

This document describes approach and results of the \pilot (the second pilot in the \dell project)
for sharing resources across borders. 
In particular, a common lightweight process for the application for resources was agreed by the participating services providers. 
It was implemented using several tools, in particular Jekyll for displaying available resources to the wider audience, Waldur for self-service request management and accounting, and Atlassian Service Desk aka Jira for implementing the workflow for resource delivery.

Finally, we provide also results of the run of the second pilot, including summary of allocated resources. 
To make it easier to compare and account for heterogeneous resources, a Billing Unit (BU) was used to convert CPU (100 hours = 1 BU) and GPU (10 hours = 1 BU) consumption to a common value. 
In total, \BUcons~Billing Units were consumed with \BUalloc~Billing Units allocated.

The user feedback from the participants who requested resources in the \pilot is included in Appendices~\ref{app:first-questions} and~\ref{app:answers} and is generally positive.

\subsection{Outline of document}

The contributed shared resources will be made available to researchers in the Nordics through merit-based competitive mechanisms. These mechanisms, for example a support structure for the open call and an ``allocation committee", will balance the capabilities, timelines and loads on the resources. This would be done through an open call from the National Providers.

\subsubsection{Intended recipients}

The National \einfra Providers and NeIC. 

\subsubsection{Delivery process}

Delivery is an operational process that supports research based usage of resources across national boundaries. 
The operational process for sharing the resources is based on the process described in~\cite{dellingr-p2-do5}.
This process is facilitated by a modified Waldur~\cite{waldur} framework.
An open call to solicit participants to test this framework was issued in June 2019.
The \pilot is run and the requests and usage of the projects and the experiences of the participants are reported in this document.
\subsubsection{Delivery date}

February 2020.

\section{Purpose of the Document}

The purpose of this document is to be the \dell project deliverable that describes how Nordic \einfra resources
can be made available to be shared across borders.

\section{Test of Cross Border Resource Sharing Framework}

The \dell project has come up with a process to enable resource sharing across national borders and be common enough so that national resource allocation policies could be integrated in a consistent manner.
In order to test the resource sharing process, test participants (users) are needed.
A framework is provided~\footnote{See \url{https://share.neic.no}} to provide these test users with an easy way to access \einfra resources.
The \einfra resources are provided by the \nps, through the \dell project, on a time and amount-limited basis to attract the test users.
Below we describe the framework we have used to facilitate the sharing and highlight how user requests have been processed.

\subsection{Framework}
\label{ssec:framework}

The main target of the \pilot were researchers that wanted to get access to computational resources.

Figure~\ref{fig:workflow} illustrates the process for resource sharing that was setup.
% is below along with more detailed explanation. 
Overall the process was done according to the description in Section 8 of~\cite{dellingr-p2-do5}.
% DO5\footnote{\url{https://wiki.neic.no/w/int/img_auth.php/6/6f/NeIC_Dellingr_DO5_to_SG_v1.pdf}} / Section 8.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=450pt]{diagram.pdf}
\caption{A graphical overview of the second \dell pilot setup and workflow.}
\label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

First of all, we have adjusted the \dell project website so it can be used as a landing page~\cite{dellingr-landing} for new users willing to get access to resources and used in promotional activities. 
The website is public and does not require any authentication.
The main components of the website included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of rules of participation in the second pilot: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/apply/}.
    \item Guide for applying for resources via \dell self-service: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/guide/}.
    \item Up to date list of computational services available to the users along with some basic technical and performance properties: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/offerings/}.
\end{itemize}
% Once the anonymous user decided that some resources available Dellingr offer is interesting, application process would start. 
Once the user had decided that some \einfra resources available in the \dell offer were interesting, the application process would start. 

\subsection{Application Process}
\label{ssec:application}

As the first step of the application process, a user had to authenticate into the \dell self-service portal using an identity provider from eduGAIN~\cite{edugain}. 
Two results were received through the usage of eduGAIN:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A reliable name and unique ID of the user in the eduGAIN federation;
    \item The domain of the organization that user belongs to.
\end{itemize}
Unfortunately without the authentication service containing reliable information on the group information about the user (affiliation, role), 
the only reliable affiliation information that could be obtained came from the domain attribute in the SAML assertion from eduGAIN. 
This meant that the user had to register their own organization by filling in the form in the self-service portal and that this affiliation information had to be manually confirmed at a later stage.

Once the user has created their organization, they are able to browse resources available for request at that moment in time. 
Over the period of the second pilot, some resources can be activated, archived or paused by the resource owners.
These actions cause the system information to be updated in the self-service portal and the user can see these changes at once.

We initially hoped to be able to automate the whole process of resource sharing across borders from request to delivery
at least for some services.
However the amount of issues connected with full automation was eventually beyond the scope of \dell resources
(e.g. modifying the source code of national allocation portals)
and it was decided to use a service desk system, Jira~\cite{jira}, for processing requests instead. 
Please note that despite this technical limitation, the process is exactly the same for both the manual and automated way.

The user had to also fill in the project information, which has been attached to all requests for resources under that project.
When requesting a resource, users had to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide estimated requirements of resources in terms of CPU and GPU hours;
    \item Provide the science domain (following the standard from~\cite{science-domains}) for which the resources
          were planned to be used;
    \item Provide nationalities of the users that were expected to get access to the resource;
    \item Agree to the terms of services of the chosen service.
\end{itemize}

Once the user submitted the information, a request to the \textbf{Virtual Allocation Committee}~\footnote{For such definitions VAC NAC etc, please see~\cite{dellingr-p2-do5}} (\textbf{VAC}) was been created. 
Upon receiving notification about new requests, the VAC validated input data to see if it is in compliance
with the Rules of participation of \dell -- and if so, forwarded the requests to the representative of the service,
aka \textbf{National Allocation Committee} (\textbf{NAC}).

The NACs took as input the request for am \einfra allocation that had the minimal commonly agreed information (see above)
as well as validation of VAC that the request conforms to the \dell policy. 
The NAC representative then could decide if the request also matches with
the policies at the requested resource and either grant or deny the application.
The amount of \einfra BUs requested by the user could be approved unchanged or be modified by the NAC representative resulting in the {\bf allocated BUs}.

To make sure that process works smoothly, a separate role –– service manager –– was in place to follow up on created tickets and assure that requests are processed in time.

\subsection{Resources}

One of the most often asked question was ``What resources do you have''?
To make sure that the answer is visible to the widest audience, we have collected various
technical information about the services and exposed parts of it on the public website.
Exposure was semi-automated, taking the JSON from the self-service (automatic) copying it to
the \dell website (manual) and publishing it as static website in Jekyll (automatic).
This has allowed to significantly reduce getting authenticated requests from users (which lead to request processing flow), who would not benefit from the provided offerings.  

Over time some service offerings are added or removed from the self-service portal according to the
policies and operations of the \nps.
% have been taken of the list due to different reasons,
Figure~\ref{fig:offerings} shows a snapshot of the \einfra resources on offer through the \dell \pilot.
% an example of state of affairs in the middle of February is shown below.
Offerings were described in more details according to a common schema and available to users inside the share.neic.no. Some of the more frequently asked attributes were brought out on the public web site.

\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{For \nps}

Overall, we see that the process implemented during the second pilot of the \dell project is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Not very intrusive for the service providers;
\item Scalable in the number of participating users and organizations, both consumers and service providers;
\item Provided additional benefits beyond the initial scope, e.g. creating a small up-to-date public catalogue of HPC services in the Nordic region without extra effort;
\item {Sensitive to miscommunication, i.e. the process needs a high level of automation so that user project continuations and requests are not missed in the reporting and/or creation process. But still not so automatic that the review process is removed;}
\item {Difficult to obtain the accounting information. Installation of a standard accounting script at many \einfra resources was not possible;}
\item{The normalization of resources to a standard billing unit was non-trivial. 
National providers and \einfra centres use differing definitions for e.g. \coreh.}
\end{itemize} 
% \todo[inline]{perhaps add an item like: Sensitive to miscommunications, i.e. the process needs a high level of automation so that project continuations and requests are not missed in the reporting and/or creation process. But still not so automatic that the review process is removed.}

\subsection{From User Feedback}

User feedback was requested from the participants during the \pilot.
There was a first set of questions sent out on 2019/10/02 to participants as it was noted that users had logged in an registered but very little activity on projects had been seen.
These questions attempted to find out of there were fundamental problems in the way that users viewed the self-service portal.
These questions and the responses are given in Appendix~\ref{app:first-questions}.

Looking at these responses from the self-service portal users and also feedback from the \dell project steering group, some changes were made to the portal.
In part, these changes were made in an attempt to reassure users to feel that
a monetary transaction was taking or about to take place.
This included: removing references to ``shopping carts"; explaining BUs are only used for common accounting purposes; explanatory text on the landing page that NeIC sponsors the costs for these \einfra resources; resolving the difference between an organization and a user; simplifying the creation of an organization by using the user eduGAIN affiliation as default.
These changes, once communicated to the users, resulted in an uptake of project creation.

A second set of questions was later (2020/01/21) sent to users 
who requested and received an allocation of BUs in the pilot.
These questions and responses are given in Appendix~\ref{app:answers}.
Of the \accepted projects accepted, we received answers from 6 of the users.
The respondents are split evenly between those that had participated in the first pilot and those who had not.
The users generally found it easy to access the ``foreign" \einfra resources, probably due to the refined procedures to accept users developed by the NACs of the national \einfra providers.
In general, these users did not have application or licencing support issues.
This might be because users are requesting through a self-service portal to run on non-local resources and are therefore more likely to have open-source software.
Of the users that have not used their allocated resources~\footnote{As of \today}, all indicated that they intend to do so.
None of the respondent users replied that this type of resource sharing/access
is not useful.
A response from more than one user indicated that this is useful for early stage researchers and method development.
The user feedback, provided in the Appendix below, has been generally favourable, which is both motivating and hints that such service could be sustained beyond the \dell lifetime.

\subsection{Publications}

As part of the ``contract" between \dell, NeIC and the pilot participants is that any work resulting from the \einfra resources accessed should have an attribution attached: 
``This work was made possible (in part) by usage of computing resources at (institution) through the NeIC Dellingr resource sharing pilot.''
The publications from the 1$^{\rm st}$ \dell pilot can be seen at~\cite{pilot-pubs}.
Gathering the publications attributed to the first \dell pilot required direct contact with the participants.
Due to the length of time for the process from data analysis to publication, it is not expected to receive notice of publications attributed to this second pilot before the official end of the \dell project.
These publications will need to be solicited after the \dell project officially ends.

\% todo[inline]{All: check this paragraph below?}
\subsection{Practicalities}

The test of cross-border resource sharing required participants to test the infrastructure and the process
and ``free'' (ultimately sponsored by NeIC through the \dell project) resources had to be
given to researchers.
This process of giving away free resources to researchers was not as easy as it seemed.
The resources were advertised through the channels available in the \np organizations and the
NeIC website~\footnote{See: \url{https://neic.no/news/2019/05/02/Dellingr-test-resource-sharing/}}.
The advertising channels that exist in the participating countries vary.
National \einfra providers directly located at a single university have a much more direct contact to
local researchers and researcher groups.
In contrast, a national \einfra provider that is physically separate from the national universities has a
direct link to local researchers and researcher groups.
This can be seen in the number of requests generated.

The timing of such pilots has to be considered carefully as 
the schedule is inevitably linked to technical development and testing of the portal etc.
This \pilot was aimed to capture the attention of the maximal number of researchers (May 2019 before the Nordic holiday season).
A subsequent effort to attract participants was made in September 2019.
Also, direct email contact with participants in the first \dell pilot was made
to attract them to test the ``new and improved'' self-service portal.

\subsection{Concluding Observations}
\label{ssec:obs}

As can be seen in the numbers of Section~\ref{sec:results}, a need can be seen for resource sharing of the type the \dell project has provided.
Researchers located in countries where a large variety and capacity of computational resources are not available, benefit by having the possibility to request resources in another country.

Also, given the cost of installing large resources capable of catering to the needs of not only local but also of international researchers, there is an argument to be made for focusing on a number of small and medium-sized resources within a country.
This would make the case for international cooperation for a few large 
internationally-available HPC centres more interesting.
This approach would have the additional benefit of ensuring that research fields where the use of HPC-resources have traditionally not been common-place can be taught locally on HPC best-practices.
These communities would then be able to make better and more efficient use of larger (shared) HPC resources.
