\section{Executive Summary}

\todo[inline]{JW: An example comment on the complete lack of executive summary... anyway we do this right at the end.}
The summary of the completed document goes here...

\subsection{Outline of document}

The contributed shared resources will be made available to researchers in the Nordics through merit-based competitive mechanisms. These mechanisms, for example a support structure for the open call and an ``allocation committee", will balance the capabilities, timelines and loads on the resources. This would be done through an open call from the National Providers.

\subsubsection{Intended recipients}

National providers and NeIC. 

\subsubsection{Delivery process}

Delivery is an operational process that supports research based usage of resources across national boundaries. 
The operational process for sharing the resources is based on the process in~\cite{dellingr-p2-do5}.
This process is facilitated by a modified Waldur~\cite{waldur} framework.
An open call to solicit participants to test this framework was issued in June 2019.
\subsubsection{Delivery date}

February 2020.

\section{Purpose of the Document}

This document describes setup of the second pilot of \dell as well as provides user feedback of the participants.

\section{Test of Cross Border Resource Sharing Framework}

The \dell project has come up with a process to enable resource sharing across national borders and be common enough so that national resource allocation policies could be integrated in a consistent manner.
In order to test the resource sharing process, test participants (users) are needed.
A framework is provided~\footnote{See \url{https://share.neic.no}} to provide these test users with an easy way to access \einfra resources.
The \einfra resources are provided by the \nps on a time and amount-limited basis to attract the test users.
Below we describe the framework we have used to facilitate the sharing and highlight how user requests have been processed.

\subsection{Framework}
\label{ssec:framework}

The main target of the \pilot were researchers that wanted to get access to computational resources.

A diagram of the process that was setup is below along with more detailed explanation. 
Overall the process was done according to the description in Section 8 
of~\cite{dellingr-p2-do5}.
% DO5\footnote{\url{https://wiki.neic.no/w/int/img_auth.php/6/6f/NeIC_Dellingr_DO5_to_SG_v1.pdf}} / Section 8.

\caption{Overview of the second \dell pilot setup}
\end{figure}

First of all, we have adjusted the \dell project website so it can be used as a landing page~\cite{dellingr-landing} for new users willing to get access to resources and used in promotional activities. 
The website is public and does not require any authentication.
The main components of the website included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of rules of participation in the second pilot: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/apply/}.
    \item Guide for applying for resources via \dell self-service: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/guide/}.
    \item Up to date list of computational services available to the users along with some basic technical and performance properties: \url{https://dellingr.neic.no/offerings/}.
\end{itemize}
% Once the anonymous user decided that some resources available Dellingr offer is interesting, application process would start. 
Once the user had decided that some \einfra resources available in the \dell offer were interesting, the application process would start. 

\subsection{Application Process}
\label{ssec:application}

As the first step of the application process, a user had to authenticate into the \dell self-service portal using an identity provider from eduGAIN~\cite{edugain}. 
Two results were received through the usage of eduGAIN:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A reliable name and unique ID of the user in the eduGAIN federation;
    \item The domain of the organization that user belongs to.
\end{itemize}
Unfortunately without the authentication service containing reliable information on the group information about the user (affiliation, role), 
the only reliable affiliation information that could be obtained came from the domain attribute in the SAML assertion from eduGAIN. 
This meant that the user had to register their own organization by filling in the form in the self-service portal and that this affiliation information had to be manually confirmed at a later stage.

Once the user has created their organization, they are able to browse resources available for request at that moment in time. 
Over the period of the second pilot, some resources can be activated, archived or paused by the resource owners.
These actions cause the system information to be updated in the self-service portal and the user can see these changes at once.

We initially hoped to be able to automate the whole process of delivery at least for some services, however the amount of issues connected with that was eventually beyond the scope of \dell resources and it was decided to use a service desk system, Jira~\cite{jira}, for processing requests instead. 
Please note that despite this technical limitation, the process is exactly the same for both the manual and automated way.

The user had to also fill in the project information, which has been attached to all requests for resources under that project.
When requesting a resource, users had to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide estimated requirements of resources in terms of CPU and GPU hours;
    \item Provide the science domain (following the standard from~\cite{science-domains}) for which the resources were planned to be used;
    \item Provide nationalities of the users that were expected to get access to the resource.
    \item Agree to the terms of services of the chosen service.
\end{itemize}

Once the user submitted the information, a request to \textbf{Virtual Allocation Committee} (\textbf{VAC}) was been created. 
Upon receiving notification about new requests, the VAC validated input data to see if it complies with the Rules of participation of \dell -- and if so, forwarded the requests to the representative of the service, aka \textbf{National Allocation Committee} (\textbf{NAC}).

NACs took as input request for allocation that had the minimal commonly agreed information (see above) as well as validation of VAC that request confirms to the \dell policy. NAC representative then could decide if the request also matches with requested resource policies and either grant or deny the application. 

To make sure that process works smoothly, a separate role –– service manager –– was in place to follow up on created tickets and assure that requests are processed in time.

\subsection{Resources}

One of the most often asked question was 'What resources do you have'? To make sure that the answer is visible to the widest audience, we have collected various technical information about the services and exposed parts of it on the public website. Exposure was semi-automated, taking the JSON from the self-service (automatic) copying it to the \dell website (manual) and publishing it as static website in Jekyll (automatic). This has allowed to significantly reduce getting authenticated requests from users (which lead to request processing flow), who would not benefit from the provided offerings.  

Over time some service offerings have been taken of the list due to different reasons, an example of state of affairs in the middle of February is shown below. Site properties were selected based on the main questions asked. One of the most requested resources was GPU access, however only one offering was providing that, which has hindered high number of requests from arriving.

\section{Conclusions}

Overall, we see that the process implemented during the second pilot of \dell is:
\begin{itemize}
\item not very intrusive for the service providers;
\item scalable in the number of participating users and organizations, both consumers and service providers;
\item provided additional benefits beyond the initial scope, e.g. creating a small up-to-date public catalogue of HPC services in the Nordic region without extra effort.
\end{itemize} 

User feedback was requested from the participants who requested and received an allocation of BUs in the pilot.
Of the 12 projects accepted, we received answers from 6 of the users.
The respondents are split evenly between those that had participated in the first pilot and those who had not.
The users generally found it easy to access the ``foreign" \einfra resources, probably due to the refined procedures to accept users developed by the NACs of the national \einfra providers.
In general, these users did not have application or licencing support issues.
This might be because users are requesting through a self-service portal to run on non-local resources and are therefore more likely to have open-source software.
Of the users that have not used their allocated resources~\footnote{As of \today}, all indicated that they intend to do so.
None of the respondent users replied that this type of resource sharing/access
is not useful.
A response from more than one user indicated that this is useful for early stage researchers and method development.
The user feedback, provided in the Appendix below, has been generally favourable, which is both motivating and hints that such service could be sustained beyond the \dell lifetime.

As part of the ``contract" between \dell, NeIC and the pilot participants is that any work resulting from the \einfra resources accessed should have an attribution attached: 
``This work was made possible (in part) by usage of computing resources at (institution) through the NeIC Dellingr resource sharing pilot.''
The publications from the 1$^{\rm st}$ \dell pilot can be seen at~\cite{pilot-pubs}.
Due to the length of time for the process from data analysis to publication, it is not expected to receive notice of publications attributed to this second pilot before the official end of the \dell project.
