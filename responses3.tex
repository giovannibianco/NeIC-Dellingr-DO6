* Did you experience any technical issues with the page?

Yes there was some login issue, but it got resolved

* Is the procedure to apply for computing resources too complex?

A bit yeah. It was unclear to me what I was getting and how I would get it

* Does the design of the page (BUs, shopping cart etc) imply a direct
cost to you?

Yes it does. I still dont know what a BU is or how I would get billed.

* Were the computing resources available of no interest to you?

They might be. If it was super easy to just logon and start using it. I
think I got my resource request rejected for my test application.

It is true that I logged in. I am also interested in applying for time. That's why I logged in, 
to check what is required.

I was looking for information regarding if I as a postdoc can apply myself, or if it I should go 
through my PI. I could not find an answer to this, maybe you know?

Primarily, I believe the problem so far has been a lack if time from my side. We 
(the research group), will most probably apply for resources soon.

Yes, I logged in to the portal, mostly to see the specs of clusters and get knowledge of the 
service and possibilities. 

* Did you experience any technical issues with the page?

no

* Is the procedure to apply for computing resources too complex?

don’t know, since I did not apply / open the application. Probably not. 

* Does the design of the page (BUs, shopping cart etc) imply a direct cost to you?

I don’t think so.

* Were the computing resources available of no interest to you?

They were interesting, and I’m mostly interested in GPU clusters. I did google the other 
clusters a bit to find out more information, so maybe the pages could 
benefit from more information about specs.

I’m already using CSC cluster (Espoo) so I did not see a reason for applying the 
"same resource” twice, if I was to be allocated to CSC.

Thanks for the follow up and nice to hear from you! I am obviously not the target user, 
but I did not know how to use the website. What would be an organization?
As someone who just followed a link I was completely lost as to what to do. Some introductory 
words about the site, intended audience, etc would help.

I didn't use the requested resources due to delays that affected my project
"Simulating Electronic and Nuclear Dynamics in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells".

Is it possible to extend the time frame for using the requested resources on the 
supercomputer Taito?
